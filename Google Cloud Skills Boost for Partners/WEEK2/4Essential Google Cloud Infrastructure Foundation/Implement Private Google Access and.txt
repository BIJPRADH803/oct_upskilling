Overview
In this lab, you implement Private Google Access and Cloud NAT for a VM instance that doesn't have an external IP address. Then, you verify access to public IP addresses of Google APIs and services and other connections to the internet.

VM instances without external IP addresses are isolated from external networks. Using Cloud NAT, these instances can access the internet for updates and patches, and in some cases, for bootstrapping. As a managed service, Cloud NAT provides high availability without user management and intervention.

Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Configure a VM instance that doesn't have an external IP address
Connect to a VM instance using an Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) tunnel
Enable Private Google Access on a subnet
Configure a Cloud NAT gateway
Verify access to public IP addresses of Google APIs and services and other connections to the internet
For each lab, you get a new Google Cloud project and set of resources for a fixed time at no cost.

Sign in to Qwiklabs using an incognito window.

Note the lab's access time (for example, 1:15:00), and make sure you can finish within that time.
There is no pause feature. You can restart if needed, but you have to start at the beginning.

When ready, click Start lab.

Note your lab credentials (Username and Password). You will use them to sign in to the Google Cloud Console.

Click Open Google Console.

Click Use another account and copy/paste credentials for this lab into the prompts.
If you use other credentials, you'll receive errors or incur charges.

Accept the terms and skip the recovery resource page.

Note: Do not click End Lab unless you have finished the lab or want to restart it. This clears your work and removes the project.

Task 1. Create the VM instance
Create a VPC network with some firewall rules and a VM instance that has no external IP address, and connect to the instance using an IAP tunnel.

Create a VPC network and firewall rules
First, create a VPC network for the VM instance and a firewall rule to allow SSH access.

In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click VPC network > VPC networks.

Click Create VPC Network.

For Name, type privatenet.

For Subnet creation mode, click Custom.

In New Subnet specify the following, and leave the remaining settings as their defaults:

Property	Value (type value or select option as specified)
Name	privatenet-us
Region	us-central1
IPv4 address range	10.130.0.0/20
Note: Don't enable Private Google access yet!
Click Done.

Click Create and wait for the network to be created.

In the left pane, click Firewall.

Click Create Firewall Rule.

Specify the following, and leave the remaining settings as their defaults:

Property	Value (type value or select option as specified)
Name	privatenet-allow-ssh
Network	privatenet
Targets	All instances in the network
Source filter	IPv4 ranges
Source IPv4 ranges	35.235.240.0/20
Protocols and ports	Specified protocols and ports
For tcp, click the checkbox and specify port 22.

Click Create.

Note: In order to connect to your private instance using SSH, you need to open an appropriate port on the firewall. IAP connections come from a specific set of IP addresses (35.235.240.0/20). Therefore, you can limit the rule to this CIDR range.
Create the VM instance with no public IP address
In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Compute Engine > VM instances.

Click Create Instance.

Specify the following, and leave the remaining settings as their defaults:

Property	Value (type value or select option as specified)
Name	vm-internal
Region	us-central1
Zone	us-central1-c
Series	E2
Machine type	e2-medium (2vCPU, 4 GB memory)
Boot disk	Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)
Click Advanced options.

Click Networking.

In Network interfaces, click the default network to edit it.

Specify the following, and leave the remaining settings as their defaults:

Property	Value (type value or select option as specified)
Network	privatenet
Subnetwork	privatenet-us
External IPv4 address	None
Note: The default setting for a VM instance is to have an ephemeral external IP address. This behavior can be changed with a policy constraint at the organization or project level. To learn more about controlling external IP addresses on VM instances, refer to the external IP address documentation.
Click Done.
Click Create, and wait for the VM instance to be created.
On the VM instances page, verify that the External IP of vm-internal is None.
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.
Create the VM instance

SSH to vm-internal to test the IAP tunnel
In the Cloud Console, click Activate Cloud Shell (Cloud Shell).
If prompted, click Continue.
To connect to vm-internal, run the following command:
gcloud compute ssh vm-internal --zone us-central1-c --tunnel-through-iap
Copied!
If prompted click Authorize
If prompted to continue, type Y.
When prompted for a passphrase, press ENTER.
When prompted for the same passphrase, press ENTER.

Did the command prompt change to @vm-internal?

True

False

To test the external connectivity of vm-internal, run the following command:
ping -c 2 www.google.com
Copied!
This should not work because vm-internal has no external IP address!

Wait for the ping command to complete.
To return to your Cloud Shell instance, run the following command:
exit
Copied!
Note: When instances do not have external IP addresses, they can only be reached by other instances on the network via a managed VPN gateway or via a Cloud IAP tunnel. Cloud IAP enables context-aware access to VMs via SSH and RDP without bastion hosts. To learn more about this, see the blog post Cloud IAP enables context-aware access to VMs via SSH and RDP without bastion hosts.
Task 2. Enable Private Google Access
VM instances that have no external IP addresses can use Private Google Access to reach external IP addresses of Google APIs and services. By default, Private Google Access is disabled on a VPC network.

Create a Cloud Storage bucket
Create a Cloud Storage bucket to test access to Google APIs and services.

In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Cloud Storage > Buckets.

Click Create.

Specify the following, and leave the remaining settings as their defaults:

Property	Value (type value or select option as specified)
Name	Enter a globally unique name
Location type	Multi-region
Click Create. If prompted to enable public access prevention, ensure it is checked and cick Confirm. Note the name of your storage bucket.

Store the name of your bucket in an environment variable:

export MY_BUCKET=<enter your bucket name here>
Copied!
Verify it with echo:
echo $MY_BUCKET
Copied!
Copy an image file into your bucket
Copy an image from a public Cloud Storage bucket to your own bucket.

In Cloud Shell, run the following command:
gcloud storage cp gs://cloud-training/gcpnet/private/access.svg gs://$MY_BUCKET
Copied!
In the Cloud Console, click your bucket name to verify that the image was copied.
You can click on the name of the image in the Cloud Console to view an example of how Private Google Access is implemented.

Access the image from your VM instance

Currently, which of your VM instances can access the image from your bucket?

vm-internal

Cloud Shell

In Cloud Shell, to try to copy the image from your bucket, run the following command:
gcloud storage cp gs://$MY_BUCKET/*.svg .
Copied!
This should work because Cloud Shell has an external IP address!

To connect to vm-internal, run the following command:
gcloud compute ssh vm-internal --zone us-central1-c --tunnel-through-iap
Copied!
If prompted, type Y to continue.

Store the name of your bucket in an environment variable:

export MY_BUCKET=<enter your bucket name here>
Copied!
Verify it with echo:
echo $MY_BUCKET
Copied!
Try to copy the image to vm-internal, run the following command:
gcloud storage cp gs://$MY_BUCKET/*.svg .
Copied!
This should not work: vm-internal can only send traffic within the VPC network because Private Google Access is disabled (by default).

Press Ctrl+Z to stop the request.
Enable Private Google Access
Private Google Access is enabled at the subnet level. When it is enabled, instances in the subnet that only have private IP addresses can send traffic to Google APIs and services through the default route (0.0.0.0/0) with a next hop to the default internet gateway.

In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click VPC network > VPC networks.
Click privatenet to open the network.
Click privatenet-us to open the subnet.
Click Edit.
For Private Google access, select On.
Click Save.
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.
Create a Cloud Storage bucket and Enable Private Google Access

Note: Enabling Private Google Access is as simple as selecting On within the subnet!
In Cloud Shell for vm-internal, to try to copy the image to vm-internal, run the following command, replacing <your_bucket_name> with the name of your bucket:
gcloud storage cp gs://$MY_BUCKET/*.svg .
Copied!
This should work because vm-internal's subnet has Private Google Access enabled!

To return to your Cloud Shell instance, run the following command:
exit
Copied!
Note: To view the eligible APIs and services that you can use with Private Google Access, see supported services in the Private access options for services Guide.
Task 3. Configure a Cloud NAT gateway
Although vm-internal can now access certain Google APIs and services without an external IP address, the instance cannot access the internet for updates and patches. Configure a Cloud NAT gateway, which allows vm-internal to reach the internet.

Try to update the VM instances
In Cloud Shell, to try to re-synchronize the package index, run the following:
sudo apt-get update
Copied!
The output should finish like this (example output):

...
Reading package lists... Done
This should work because Cloud Shell has an external IP address!

To connect to vm-internal, run the following command:
gcloud compute ssh vm-internal --zone us-central1-c --tunnel-through-iap
Copied!
If prompted, type Y to continue.
To try to re-synchronize the package index of vm-internal, run the following command:
sudo apt-get update
Copied!
This should only work for Google Cloud packages because vm-internal only has access to Google APIs and services!

Press Ctrl+C to stop the request.
Configure a Cloud NAT gateway
Cloud NAT is a regional resource. You can configure it to allow traffic from all ranges of all subnets in a region, from specific subnets in the region only, or from specific primary and secondary CIDR ranges only.

In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Network services > Cloud NAT.

Click Get started to configure a NAT gateway.

Specify the following:

Property	Value (type value or select option as specified)
Gateway name	nat-config
Network	privatenet
Region	us-central1
For Cloud Router, select Create new router.

For Name, type nat-router

Click Create.

Note: The NAT mapping section allows you to choose the subnets to map to the NAT gateway. You can also manually assign static IP addresses that should be used when performing NAT. Do not change the NAT mapping configuration in this lab.
Click Create.
Wait for the gateway's status to change to Running.
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.
Configure a Cloud NAT gateway

Verify the Cloud NAT gateway
It may take up to 3 minutes for the NAT configuration to propagate to the VM, so wait at least a minute before trying to access the internet again.

In Cloud Shell for vm-internal, to try to re-synchronize the package index of vm-internal, run the following command:
sudo apt-get update
Copied!
The output should finish like this (example output):

...
Reading package lists... Done
This should work because vm-internal is using the NAT gateway!

To return to your Cloud Shell instance, run the following command:
exit
Copied!
Note: The Cloud NAT gateway implements outbound NAT, but not inbound NAT. In other words, hosts outside of your VPC network can only respond to connections initiated by your instances; they cannot initiate their own, new connections to your instances via NAT.
Task 4. Configure and view logs with Cloud NAT Logging
Cloud NAT logging allows you to log NAT connections and errors. When Cloud NAT logging is enabled, one log entry can be generated for each of the following scenarios:

When a network connection using NAT is created.
When a packet is dropped because no port was available for NAT.
You can opt to log both kinds of events, or just one or the other. Created logs are sent to Cloud Logging.

Enabling logging
If logging is enabled, all collected logs are sent to Cloud Logging by default. You can filter these so that only certain logs are sent.

You can also specify these values when you create a NAT gateway or by editing one after it has been created. The following directions show how to enable logging for an existing NAT gateway.

In the GCP Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Network services > Cloud NAT.

Click on the nat-config gateway and then click Edit.

Click the Advanced configurations dropdown to open that section.

Under Stackdriver logging, select Translation and errors and then click Save.

NAT logging in Cloud Operations
Now that you have set up Cloud NAT logging for the nat-config gateway, let's find out where we can view our logs.

Click on nat-config to expose its details. Then click on the Logs tab. Then click the link to Cloud Logging.

This will open a new tab with Operations Logging.

You will see that there aren't any logs yet—that's because we just enabled this feature for the gateway. Keep this tab open and return to your other GCP Console tab.

Generating logs
As a reminder, Cloud NAT logs are generated for the following sequences:

When a network connection using NAT is created.
When a packet is dropped because no port was available for NAT.
Let's connect the host to the internal VM again to see if any logs are generated.

In Cloud Shell for vm-internal, to try to re-synchronize the package index of vm-internal, run the following command:
gcloud compute ssh vm-internal --zone us-central1-c --tunnel-through-iap
Copied!
If prompted, type Y to continue.
Try to re-synchronize the package index of vm-internal by running the following:
sudo apt-get update
Copied!
The output should look like this (example output):

...
Reading package lists... Done
To return to your Cloud Shell instance, run the following command:
exit
Copied!
Let's see if opening up this connection revealed anything new in our logs.

Viewing Logs
Return to your Operations Logging tab and in the navigation menu, click Logs Explorer.
You should see two new logs that were generated after connecting to the internal VM.

Note: You may need to wait for a few minutes. If you are still unable to see the logs, repeat step 1 to step 4, from the Generating logs section, and then refresh the logging page.
As we see, the logs give us details on the VPC network we connected to and the connection method we used. Feel free to expand different labels and details.

Task 5. Review
You created vm-internal, an instance with no external IP address, and connected to it securely using an IAP tunnel. Then you enabled Private Google Access, configured a NAT gateway, and verified that vm-internal can access Google APIs and services and other public IP addresses.

VM instances without external IP addresses are isolated from external networks. Using Cloud NAT, these instances can access the internet for updates and patches, and in some cases, for bootstrapping. As a managed service, Cloud NAT provides high availability without user management and intervention.

IAP uses your existing project roles and permissions when you connect to VM instances. By default, instance owners are the only users that have the IAP Secured Tunnel User role.

For how to allow other users to access your VMs using IAP tunneling, see, in the Cloud Architecture Center, Grant access to additional users Guide.
