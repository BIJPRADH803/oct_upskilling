Overview
In this lab, you set up a game application—a Minecraft server.

The Minecraft server software will run on a Compute Engine instance.

You use an e2-medium machine type that includes a 10-GB boot disk, 2 virtual CPU (vCPU), and 4 GB of RAM. This machine type runs Debian Linux by default.

To make sure there is plenty of room for the Minecraft server's world data, you also attach a high-performance 50-GB persistent solid-state drive (SSD) to the instance. This dedicated Minecraft server can support up to 50 players.

Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Customize an application server
Install and configure necessary software
Configure network access
Schedule regular backups
Qwiklabs setup
For each lab, you get a new Google Cloud project and set of resources for a fixed time at no cost.

Sign in to Qwiklabs using an incognito window.

Note the lab's access time (for example, 1:15:00), and make sure you can finish within that time.
There is no pause feature. You can restart if needed, but you have to start at the beginning.

When ready, click Start lab.

Note your lab credentials (Username and Password). You will use them to sign in to the Google Cloud Console.

Click Open Google Console.

Click Use another account and copy/paste credentials for this lab into the prompts.
If you use other credentials, you'll receive errors or incur charges.

Accept the terms and skip the recovery resource page.

Note: Do not click End Lab unless you have finished the lab or want to restart it. This clears your work and removes the project.

Task 2. Prepare the data disk
Create a directory and format and mount the disk
The disk is attached to the instance, but it is not yet mounted or formatted.

For mc-server, click SSH to open a terminal and connect.
To create a directory that serves as the mount point for the data disk, run the following command:
sudo mkdir -p /home/minecraft
Copied!
To format the disk, run the following command:
sudo mkfs.ext4 -F -E lazy_itable_init=0,\
lazy_journal_init=0,discard \
/dev/disk/by-id/google-minecraft-disk
Copied!

Copied!
No output is displayed after the disk is mounted.

Click Check my progress to verify the objective.

Create the VM and prepare the data disk
Task 3. Install and run the application
The Minecraft server runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), so it requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run. Because the server doesn't need a graphical user interface, you use the headless version of the JRE. This reduces the JRE's resource usage on the machine, which helps ensure that the Minecraft server has enough room to expand its own resource usage if needed.

Install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Minecraft server
In the SSH terminal for mc-server, to update the Debian repositories on the VM, run the following command:
sudo apt-get update
Copied!
After the repositories are updated, to install the headless JRE, run the following command:
sudo apt-get install -y default-jre-headless
Copied!
To navigate to the directory where the persistent disk is mounted, run the following command:
cd /home/minecraft
Copied!
To install wget, run the following command:
sudo apt-get install wget
Copied!
If prompted to continue, type Y.

To download the current Minecraft server JAR file (1.11.2 JAR), run the following command:

sudo wget https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/d0d0fe2b1dc6ab4c65554cb734270872b72dadd6/server.jar
Copied!
Initialize the Minecraft server
To initialize the Minecraft server, run the following command:
sudo java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui
Copied!
Result (example output):

[21:01:54] [main/ERROR]: Failed to load properties from file: server.properties
[21:01:54] [main/WARN]: Failed to load eula.txt
[21:01:54] [main/INFO]: You need to agree to the EULA in order to run the server. Go to eula.txt for more info.
Note: The Minecraft server won't run unless you accept the terms of the End User Licensing Agreement (EULA).
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.

Install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Minecraft server
To see the files that were created in the first initialization of the Minecraft server, run the following command:
sudo ls -l
Copied!
Note: You could edit the server.properties file to change the default behavior of the Minecraft server.
To edit the EULA, run the following command:
sudo nano eula.txt
Copied!
Change the last line of the file from eula=false to eula=true.
Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.
Note: Don't try to restart the Minecraft server yet. You use a different technique in the next procedure.
Create a virtual terminal screen to start the Minecraft server
If you start the Minecraft server again now, it is tied to the life of your SSH session: that is, if you close your SSH terminal, the server is also terminated. To avoid this issue, you can use screen, an application that allows you to create a virtual terminal that can be "detached," becoming a background process, or "reattached," becoming a foreground process. When a virtual terminal is detached to the background, it will run whether you are logged in or not.

To install screen, run the following command:
sudo apt-get install -y screen
Copied!
To start your Minecraft server in a screen virtual terminal, run the following command (using the -S flag to name your terminal mcs):
sudo screen -S mcs java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui
Copied!
Result (example output):

[21:06:11] [Server thread/INFO]: Done (102.484s)! For help, type "help"
Detach from the screen and close your SSH session
To detach the screen terminal, press Ctrl+A, Ctrl+D. The terminal continues to run in the background. To reattach the terminal, run the following command:
sudo screen -r mcs
Copied!
If necessary, exit the screen terminal by pressing Ctrl+A, Ctrl+D.
To exit the SSH terminal, run the following command:
exit
Copied!
Congratulations! You set up and customized a VM and installed and configured application software—a Minecraft server!

Task 4. Allow client traffic
Up to this point, the server has an external static IP address, but it cannot receive traffic because there is no firewall rule in place. Minecraft server uses TCP port 25565 by default. So you need to configure a firewall rule to allow these connections.

Create a firewall rule
In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click VPC network > Firewall.
Click Create firewall rule.
Specify the following and leave the remaining settings as their defaults:
Property	Value (type value or select option as specified)
Name	minecraft-rule
Target	Specified target tags
Target tags	minecraft-server
Source filter	IPv4 ranges
Source IPv4 ranges	0.0.0.0/0
Protocols and ports	Specified protocols and ports
For tcp, specify port 25565.
Click Create. Users can now access your server from their Minecraft clients.
Verify server availability
In the left pane, click IP addresses.
Locate and copy the External IP address for the mc-server VM.
Use Minecraft Server Status to test your Minecraft server.
Note: If the above website is not working, you can use a different site or the Chrome extension:

Minecraft Server Status Checker
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.

Allow client traffic
Task 5. Schedule regular backups
Backing up your application data is a common activity. In this case, you configure the system to back up Minecraft world data to Cloud Storage.

Create a Cloud Storage bucket
On the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click Compute Engine > VM instances.
For mc-server, click SSH.
Create a globally unique bucket name, and store it in the environment variable YOUR_BUCKET_NAME. To make it unique, you can use your Project ID. Run the following command:
export YOUR_BUCKET_NAME=<Enter your bucket name here>
Copied!
Verify it with echo:
echo $YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
Copied!
To create the bucket using the gcloud storage tool, part of the Cloud SDK, run the following command:
gcloud storage buckets create gs://$YOUR_BUCKET_NAME-minecraft-backup
Copied!
Note: If this command failed, you might not have created a unique bucket name. If so, choose another bucket name, update your environment variable, and try to create the bucket again.
Note: To make this environment variable permanent, you can add it to the root's .profile by running this command:
echo YOUR_BUCKET_NAME=$YOUR_BUCKET_NAME >> ~/.profile
Create a backup script
In the mc-server SSH terminal, navigate to your home directory:
cd /home/minecraft
Copied!
To create the script, run the following command:
sudo nano /home/minecraft/backup.sh
Copied!
Copy and paste the following script into the file:
#!/bin/bash
screen -r mcs -X stuff '/save-all\n/save-off\n'
/usr/bin/gcloud storage cp -R ${BASH_SOURCE%/*}/world gs://${YOUR_BUCKET_NAME}-minecraft-backup/$(date "+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")-world
screen -r mcs -X stuff '/save-on\n'
Copied!
Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file, and press Ctrl+X to exit nano.
Note: The script saves the current state of the server's world data and pauses the server's auto-save functionality. Next, it backs up the server's world data directory (world) and places its contents in a timestamped directory (<timestamp>-world) in the Cloud Storage bucket. After the script finishes backing up the data, it resumes auto-saving on the Minecraft server.
To make the script executable, run the following command:
sudo chmod 755 /home/minecraft/backup.sh
Copied!
Test the backup script and schedule a cron job
In the mc-server SSH terminal, run the backup script:
. /home/minecraft/backup.sh
Copied!
After the script finishes, return to the Cloud Console.
To verify that the backup file was written, on the Navigation menu ( Navigation menu icon), click Cloud Storage > Buckets.
Click on the backup bucket name. You should see a folder with a date-time stamp name. Now that you've verified that the backups are working, you can schedule a cron job to automate the task.
In the mc-server SSH terminal, open the cron table for editing:
sudo crontab -e
Copied!
When you are prompted to select an editor, type the number corresponding to nano, and press ENTER.
At the bottom of the cron table, paste the following line:
0 */4 * * * /home/minecraft/backup.sh
Copied!
Note: That line instructs cron to run backups every 4 hours.
Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the cron table, and press Ctrl+X to exit nano.
Note: This creates about 300 backups a month in Cloud Storage, so you will want to regularly delete them to avoid charges. Cloud Storage offers the Object Lifecycle Management feature to set a Time to Live (TTL) for objects, archive older versions of objects, or "downgrade" storage classes of objects to help manage costs.
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.

Schedule regular backups
Task 6. Server maintenance
To perform server maintenance, you need to shut down the server.

Connect via SSH to the server, stop it and shut down the VM
In the mc-server SSH terminal, run the following command:
sudo screen -r -X stuff '/stop\n'
Copied!
In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu ( Navigation menu icon), click Compute Engine > VM instances.
Click mc-server.
Click Stop.
In the confirmation dialog, click Stop to confirm. You will be logged out of your SSH session.
Note: To start up your instance again, visit the instance page and then click Start. To start the Minecraft server again, you can establish an SSH connection with the instance, remount your persistent disk, and start your Minecraft server in a new screen terminal, just as you did previously.
Automate server maintenance with startup and shutdown scripts
Instead of following the manual process to mount the persistent disk and launch the server application in a screen, you can use metadata scripts to create a startup script and a shutdown script to do this for you.

Click mc-server.

Click Edit.

For Metadata, click + Add Item and specify the following:

Key	Value
startup-script-url	https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/archinfra/mcserver/startup.sh
shutdown-script-url	https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/archinfra/mcserver/shutdown.sh
Note: You'll have to click Add item to add the shutdown-script-url. When you restart your instance, the startup script automatically mounts the Minecraft disk to the appropriate directory, starts your Minecraft server in a screen session, and detaches the session. When you stop the instance, the shutdown script shuts down your Minecraft server before the instance shuts down. It's a best practice to store these scripts in Cloud Storage.
Click Save.
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.

Server maintenance
Task 7. Review
In this lab, you created a customized virtual machine instance by installing base software (a headless JRE) and application software (a Minecraft game server). You customized the VM by attaching and preparing a high-speed SSD data disk, and you reserved a static external IP so the address would remain consistent. Then you verified availability of the gaming server online.

You set up a backup system to back up the server's data to a Cloud Storage bucket, and you tested the backup system. Then you automated backups using cron. Finally, you set up maintenance scripts using metadata for graceful startup and shutdown of the server.
